# Example 5: Exploring the Full Timeline

**Scenario**: You want to understand the overall shape of US copyright law — how it grew from a single statute to 122 sections, and how active Congress has been in amending it.

## How many acts have amended copyright law?

```
$ git log --oneline | wc -l
122
```

122 commits (121 acts plus the initial commit), from 1790 to 2025.

## Tags mark the major milestones

```
$ git tag -l
v1790
v1831
v1870
v1909
v1976
v1984-chips
v1988-berne
v1998-ctea
v1998-dmca
v2018-mma
v2020-case
```

## Compare entire eras

### The 1976 rewrite

The Copyright Act of 1976 was the most sweeping change in the repository. It replaced the entire pre-1976 structure with the modern section numbering:

```
$ git diff v1909 v1976 --stat | tail -5
  87 files changed, 1711 insertions(+), 509 deletions(-)
```

87 files changed — the pre-1976 era files were removed and the modern section files were created.

### The digital era (1976 to DMCA)

```
$ git log --oneline v1976..v1998-dmca | wc -l
40
```

40 acts amended copyright law in the 22 years between the 1976 Act and the DMCA. That's roughly two acts per year.

## Read the law at any point in time

Want to know exactly what copyright law said on, say, June 1, 1991? Run `git rev-list -1 --before="1991-06-01" main` to get the commit for the most recent amendment as of that date, then `git show` or `git checkout` it.

Now every file in `sections/` reflects the law as it existed at that moment. Browse freely, then return:

```
git checkout main
```

## Trace a single section from birth to present

Example: Section 107 (fair use), perhaps the most cited section in copyright law:

```
$ git log --oneline -- sections/107.md
be4fde3 Fair Use of Unpublished Works Act of 1992
f12a20b Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 (VARA)
6d717db (tag: v1976) Copyright Act of 1976
```

Fair use has been amended only twice since the 1976 Act codified it. This is notable — one of the most litigated provisions in copyright law has been left almost entirely to judicial interpretation.

## Count amendments per section

To find the most-amended sections:

```
$ for f in sections/*.md; do
    count=$(git log --oneline -- "$f" | wc -l)
    echo "$count $f"
  done | sort -rn | head -10
```

This reveals which parts of the law Congress returns to most often — useful for understanding where the law is most contested or most in flux.

## The first federal copyright law

```
git show v1790 -- pre-1976/copyright-act-of-1790.md
```

The Copyright Act of 1790 protected "maps, charts, and books" for 14 years with a 14-year renewal. Compare that to today's law — life of the author plus 70 years.
