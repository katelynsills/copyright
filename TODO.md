# Open Issues / Things to Verify (In Progress)

## Acts Requiring Complex Manual Reconstruction (in progress)
These acts involve very large sections (§110, §111, §112, §114, §118, §119) that underwent multiple complete chapter-level rewrites (PL 108-419 in 2004 rewrote the entire royalty chapter; PL 111-175 in 2010 rewrote §119). Reconstructing intermediate versions requires access to the full text of each version, which is beyond what can be derived from amendment notes alone.

### Partial fixes applied (CRJ anachronism removal, structural changes)
All six sections had "Copyright Royalty Judges" (a 2004 term) in pre-2004 versions. Fixed to use "Copyright Royalty Tribunal" (pre-1993) or "Librarian of Congress" (1993-2004) as appropriate. §112 subsec (f) addition/removal reconstructed. §110 par. (10)/(11) addition/removal reconstructed. §118 fully reconstructed with correct CRT/LoC/CRJ transitions across all versions.

### Substantive fixes applied
- [x] TEACH Act of 2002 — §110 par. (2) replaced with original pre-TEACH text in v0-v3; TEACH concluding provisions (mediated instructional activities, accreditation, transient storage) removed from pre-TEACH versions
- [x] Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994 — §111: removed "microwave," insertion, satellite carrier subsec (a)(4), and television market §76.55(e) reference from pre-1994 versions
- [x] Small Webcaster Amendments Act of 2002 — §114: removed webcaster agreement paragraph (f)(4), restored original subsec (g)(2), removed (g)(3)-(4) from pre-2002 versions
- [x] Webcaster Settlement Acts of 2008/2009 — §114: reversed WSA-specific changes (dates, references, "small commercial" terminology) in pre-WSA versions
- [x] Letter of direction (PL 115-264) — §114: removed subsec (g)(5) from all pre-2018 versions
- [x] §119 pre-STELA reconstruction — replaced all pre-2010 versions with authentic pre-STELA text sourced from GovInfo 2009 U.S. Code edition; applied correct date substitutions for 2010 temporary extension acts (PL 111-118, 111-144, 111-151, 111-157)

### Remaining (intermediate version differentiation — in progress)
- [x] §119 post-STELA reconstruction — v17 (PL 111-175) and v18 (PL 113-200) replaced with authentic post-STELA text sourced from GovInfo 2018 U.S. Code edition; 14 paragraphs in (a), subsections through (h), "non-network station" terminology, "paragraphs (4), (5), and (7)" references
- [x] §119 pre-STELA base text — v0-v16 replaced with authentic pre-STELA text from GovInfo 2009 U.S. Code edition; uses "superstation", 16 paragraphs in (a), correct paragraph cross-references
- [x] §119 institutional terminology — CRT (v0, 1988), LoC (v1-v7, 1993-2002), CRJ (v8+, 2004+)
- [x] §119 PL 110-403 (Pro-IP Act 2008) — reversed "sections 509 and 510" → "section 510" and "506 and 509" removals for v0-v10
- [x] §119 PL 111-118 date changes — v0-v11 use "December 31, 2009"; v12-v13 use "February 28, 2010"; v14-v16 use progressive temp extension dates
- [x] §119 PL 103-369 (SHVA 1994) — reversed cents amounts (12→17.5/14, 3→6), date of enactment text, (d)(2) network station definition, (d)(6) FCC service language for v0-v1
- [x] §119 PL 104-39 (DPRA 1995) — removed "and section 114(d)" insertion from v0-v2
- [x] §111 intermediate version differentiation — v0-v3 differentiated: PL 100-667 (a)(4)→(5) renumbering + §119 exclusion; PL 101-318 "recorded the notice" removal; PL 103-198 CRT consultation phrases + d(2)/d(4)(B) text restoration

§119 still has 8 identical adjacent version pairs remaining (v3-v7 share LoC pre-STELA text; v8-v10 share CRJ pre-v11 text; v12-v13; v19-v20). Further differentiation requires identifying specific text changes from PL 105-80, 106-44, 106-113, 107-273, 108-447, 109-303 within the pre-STELA structure.

## Acts With No File Changes (originally 23 — most now fixed)

These acts exist as commits in the repo but have empty `files_changed` in acts.json. Most have been fixed; remaining items are blocked on complex reconstruction.

### Remaining (identical snapshot text — needs manual version differentiation)
- [ ] TEACH Act of 2002 (PL 107-273, Subtitle C) — snapshot files identical to Intellectual Property Technical Amendments (Subtitle B); both subtitles need distinct intermediate versions
- [ ] Library of Congress Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (PL 116-94, Title XIV) — §802 snapshot identical to prior version (auto-reversal incomplete)

## Testing Gaps Around Silently-Dropped Amendments

PR #10 fixed §512 attribution for PL 106-44 (1999) and PL 111-295 (2010). Both amendments were listed in `data/amendment-notes/512-notes.md` and surfaced in `data/snapshots/512-versions.json` with `auto_reversed: false`, but because reconstruct.py couldn't reverse the heading-case changes and small strikeouts, all four version texts in the JSON came out byte-identical. `prepare_build_data.py` then wrote identical act-snapshots, and `build.py` produced empty diffs, so `git log -- sections/512.md` only showed the DMCA commit. The fix was a manual edit of two act-snapshot files; PR #10 also added three targeted regression tests in `tests/test_audit.py` (TestVersionStructure.test_dmca_commit_creates_512, test_pl_106_44_commit_touches_512, test_pl_111_295_commit_touches_512).

### Why no test caught this
- The existing per-act-touches-section assertions in `test_audit.py` are spot checks for famous acts only (Berne→§104, VARA→§113). No systematic rule of the form "every PL listed in `<section>-versions.json` must produce a commit touching that section file in the output repo."
- Text-content tests in `test_sections_legal.py` and `test_audit.py` check the *content* of reconstructed text. When all four §512 versions were byte-identical, those tests still passed.
- `test_pipeline.py` exercises pipeline functions as unit tests but doesn't go end-to-end. Nothing wired together "PL listed in amendment notes → version reconstructed → act-snapshot written → commit produced in output repo."

### Same bug class likely affects 50+ other sections
Survey (run from the repo root):

```python
import json, glob, os
for f in sorted(glob.glob('data/snapshots/*-versions.json')):
    sec = os.path.basename(f).replace('-versions.json', '')
    fails = [v for v in json.load(open(f))['versions'] if v.get('auto_reversed') is False]
    if fails:
        print(f'{sec}: {len(fails)} failed')
```

Result: 53 sections with `auto_reversed: false` somewhere in their version chain, 142 failed reversals total. Highest counts: §119 (20), §101 (14), §114 (10), §111 (7), §110 (6). Each one is a candidate for the same silent-drop bug §512 had.

### TODO
- [ ] Add a systematic test that asserts: for every section S, for every public_law PL in `S-versions.json` (excluding the creation PL), the corresponding commit in copyright-history must touch `sections/S.md`. Pseudo:
  ```python
  for sec, data in all_section_versions:
      for v in data['versions'][:-1]:  # skip final "current" entry
          pl = v['public_law']
          if not pl: continue
          act_commit = commit_for_pl(pl)
          diff = git('diff', f'{act_commit}~1', act_commit, '--name-only')
          assert f'sections/{sec}.md' in diff
  ```
  Expect this test to fail for ~140 (section, PL) pairs initially. Use it as the punch list for follow-up manual reconstructions, the same way §512 was fixed.
- [ ] For each of the 53 affected sections, audit which amendments are silently dropped and decide which need manual reconstruction (substantive changes) vs. which can be left flagged (purely typographical / numbering changes that don't matter for legal-research use cases).
- [ ] Consider a `tests/test_attribution.py` that runs the systematic test above with the failing pairs in an `expectedFailures` list, so new regressions are caught while the existing backlog is worked down.
